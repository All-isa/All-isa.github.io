            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an ambitious, creative, and resourceful full stack web developer who is driven to continuously learn new technologies and creative skills. I have a multifaceted background in customer service, photography, and entrepreneurship that has given me a strong ability to communicate effectively and multitask like a master. I've just recently completed an intensive 24 week coding bootcamp in which I gained more inspiration and knowledge than my brain thought possible.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond technology I am a mother to a feisty daughter, a foodie, a music lover and a treehugger. In my free time you might find me hiking, reading, learning new languages or expanding on previous knowledge, as well as exploring this wide world we all call home.</p>
